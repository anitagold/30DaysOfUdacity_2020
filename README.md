# 30DaysOfUdacity_2020

# What is the #30DaysofUdacity challenge?
The premise of this challenge is to build a habit of practicing new skills by making a public commitment of practicing the topic of your program every day for 30 days. 

Why? Because habits that emphasize consistent practice have been proven to help overall retention of new learning material. Students like you have succeeded in not only making it through the finish line of their program by incorporating this daily practice, but also have deepened their learning and mastery of new skills.
